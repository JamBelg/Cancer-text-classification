Text classification with deep learning leverages the power of deep neural networks to automatically extract complex features from textual data. By using techniques like recurrent neural networks (RNNs), convolutional neural networks (CNNs), or transformer models, deep learning enables accurate and efficient categorization of text into predefined classes, making it a robust and widely adopted approach in natural language processing tasks.

The cancer data is from Kaggle.
